            <h3>SHAHD ALRAHBI</h3>
            <p id="Pp"> I hold an Advance Diploma in Information Technology: Software Engineering from the University of
                Technology and Applied Sciences: Higher College of Technology,
                completed between 2017 and 2022. Fluent in Arabic and with an upper intermediate level of English
                proficiency, I am well-equipped to contribute to the success of any organization in the field of mobile
                app & web development.
                I am actively seeking a position within a dynamic and expanding organization where I can utilize my
                creative and innovative skills for the benefit of both the organization and my personal growth. With a
                strong foundation in programming languages, including Java and Dart,
                I have honed my abilities to develop mobile applications from scratch. My technical skills include
                problem-solving, Android native app development, Flutter multi-platform development, as well as web
                development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
